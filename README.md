Approach & Thought Process:

I focused on building a minimal but functional fullstack app. The goal was to demonstrate a working GraphQL backend and a React frontend with Docker Compose orchestration. I prioritized simplicity over features — keeping persistence in-memory and skipping advanced concerns like authentication or testing. This allowed me to concentrate on ensuring that the backend, frontend, and Docker setup all worked seamlessly together.




AI Tools & Models Used:

ChatGPT (GPT-5) — used for generating GraphQL schema, resolver stubs, React components, and Docker configuration.


Reflections on Effectiveness

What Worked:

AI provided boilerplate for backend resolvers, GraphQL schema, and Apollo Client queries.
Dockerfile and docker-compose templates were generated quickly and required minimal tweaking.
Folder structure suggestions saved time during setup.



What Didn’t Work:

Networking between frontend and backend containers sometimes required manual edits.
AI-generated TypeScript often needed type fixes and cleanup.


How AI Helped:

Reduced setup time by generating starter code and configuration files.
Helped debug GraphQL errors by suggesting quick fixes.
Assisted in documenting the project clearly.
